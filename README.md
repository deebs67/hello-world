# hello-world
The Github hello-world tutorial

Here, I am making some edits to this readme, while following the tutorial steps at:
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

This is being done on a new branch, called 'readme-edits'

N.B. There's a good Github tutorial on Youtube at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE

Some useful commands taught in that tutorial are:
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "some commit message"
git push
git checkout -- filename  # To restore a file which has been deleted

For some reason, those above commands appear on separate lines in a file editor, but all on the same line on the Github web page.
